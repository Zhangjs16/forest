What is it?
Forest is a simple image analysis program designed to estimate forest canopy cover based on photographs taken from below. It is intended to speed up vegetation analysis process especially the estimation of forest canopy cover.

How to

1.	Get a photograph of forest/trees from below, and copy it to your computer.
2.	Open the app and browse for the photo, and double click it.
3.	Once the file is chosen it will show the reference picture.
4.	Click Analyze Image Button for the thresholding process to be started.
5.	After it finished it will show the result and statistics.
6.	If you see that there is over of underestimation, play around with the threshold field and press analyze again.

The Interface
 
1.	Picture reference window provides the actual image being processed.
2.	The image used can be browsed through a file browser.
3.	Picture analysis window shows the result of the simplification of cover from image, by removing non tree objects, even the background.
4.	The picture statistics consists of the quantitative pixel data of the image. It includes pixel count, percent cover, pix height and pix width.
5.	Analyze image button will trigger picture analysis and displaying statistics.
6.	Threshold can be adjusted if you want more/less sensitivity of thresholding.
